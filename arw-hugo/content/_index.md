## About me:
I am a postdoctoral researcher with [Raphael Jungers](https://perso.uclouvain.be/raphael.jungers/content/home) at UCLouvain.
I obtained my PhD in 2024 at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, studying control theory under my coadvisors [Necmiye Ozay](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~necmiye/)
and [Stephane Lafortune](https://eecs.engin.umich.edu/people/lafortune-stephane/).
I graduated from the University of Tennessee,
Knoxville in 2018 with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Mathematics.

## My research:

I am currently working on symbolic and abstraction-based control of cyberphysical systems.
I am also interested security and safety of these systems within the framework of hybrid systems and discrete event systems.
To this end, I have worked on privacy verification and enforcement as well as control invariant set computation.
